# AI-Driven-Facial-Recognition-with-Geolocation-For-Lost-individual
AI-based system to identify faces and track geolocation for lost individuals
# AI-Driven Facial Recognition with Geolocation for Lost Individuals

## 📌 Overview
AI-Driven Facial Recognition with Geolocation is an intelligent system designed to help **identify and locate lost or missing individuals** by combining **face recognition technology** with **geolocation tracking**.

The project uses Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision techniques to detect faces, recognize individuals, and associate their location data to support search and identification efforts.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Finding lost individuals is time-consuming and challenging using manual methods. There is a need for an **automated system** that can quickly identify individuals using facial data and track their geographical location efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect and recognize human faces using AI
- Store and compare facial features accurately
- Capture and associate geolocation data
- Assist authorities and organizations in locating lost individuals
- Provide a scalable and user-friendly system

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Face Recognition (Dlib-based)
- Flask (Web framework)
- Geolocation API (GPS / IP-based)
- MongoDB / Firebase (Database)

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Face detection from images or camera
- Facial recognition and matching
- Geolocation capture and storage
- Secure data management
- Web-based interface
- Modular and extensible design

http://127.0.0.1:5000
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 System Working (Simple Explanation)
-User uploads or captures an image
-System detects faces using OpenCV
-Facial features are extracted
-Face is compared with stored data
-If matched, identity is confirmed
-Geolocation data is captured
-Location helps track the individual

📚 Use Cases

-Missing person identification
